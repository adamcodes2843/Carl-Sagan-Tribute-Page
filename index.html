The search for ancient life advances. Carl Sagan acted as an advisor and consultant to NASA since the 1950's and promoted the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI). Torrence Johnson, a colleague, said "Carl was one of the greatest intellects behind the genesis of space exploration.." NASA's dedicated Carl Sagan Center provides leading-edge research and collaboration accross disciplines to continue the search in his name.

        <div class="quote-text">Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time – when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness...The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30 second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance.</div>

We long for a Parent to care for us, to forgive us our errors, to save us from our childish mistakes. But knowledge is preferable to ignorance. Better by far to embrace the hard truth than a reassuring fable.”</div>
